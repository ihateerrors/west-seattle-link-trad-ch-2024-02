                <p>The extensions were initially on the same environmental review timeline. However, given additional environmental review needed for project refinements for BLE resulting from the Sound Transit Board action in March 2023, environmental review for the two extensions will now proceed on different timelines.</p>
                <p>WSLE will proceed to a Final EIS, which is anticipated to be published in 2024, while a new Draft EIS will be completed for BLE. Visit the <a href="https://ballardlink.participate.online/" target="_blank">Ballard Link Extension</a> project page for details.</p>

              Preferred alternative for the West Seattle Link Extension
            </h3>
            <p class="pt-1">
              In July 2022, the Sound Transit Board identified the preferred alternative for the West Seattle Link Extension and requested further studies of refinements to the preferred alternative. Read the July 2022 <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/sound-transit-board-identifies-preferred-alternative-west" target="_blank">press release</a> and the <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/st_sharepoint/download/sites/PRDA/ActiveDocuments/Motion%20M2022-57.pdf" target="_blank">Board Motion</a> for more information. Refinements from the further studies are being incorporated into the WSLE Final EIS. 
            </p>


            <ul class="main-ul">
              <li>Medium Tunnel 41st Avenue Station Alternative in the West Seattle Junction segment, incorporating refinement to West Entrance that shifts station entrance to 42nd Avenue Southwest.</li>
              <li>The Andover Street Station Lower Height Alternative in the Delridge segment, incorporating refinement that shifts the alignment south towards Southwest Yancy Street.</li>
              <li>The South Crossing Alternative in the Duwamish segment.</li>
              <li>The At-grade Alternative Staggered Station Configuration in the SODO segment, incorporating refinement that enhances access from the platform to South Lander Street.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the WSLE preferred alternative, all West Link Extension alternatives that were studied in the WSBLE Draft EIS, as well cost savings and refinement concepts identified in <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/st_sharepoint/download/sites/PRDA/ActiveDocuments/Motion%20M2022-57.pdf" target="_blank">July 2022 Board Motion</a>, will be studied in the WSLE Final EIS.</p>

                <h3>SODO segment</h3>
                <p class="fw-bold">Preferred Alternative: At-Grade Lander Access Station Option (SODO-1c)</p>
                <p>Is a refinement of the Draft EIS Preferred Alternative At-Grade Alternative, staggered configuration, and reflects Sound Transit Board direction in Motion 2022-57 identifying the preferred alternative to explore opportunities to enhance access from the station platform to South Lander Street. It would begin north of the existing SODO Station and travel at-grade west of and parallel to the existing Link light rail line in the SODO Busway. The new SODO Station on the West Seattle Link Extension would be at-grade, immediately west of the existing SODO Station, north of South Lander Street in a staggered configuration. The station would include an access point at South Lander Street. Access to 4th Avenue South would occur via South Lander Street. The existing at-grade pedestrian crossing of the light rail tracks at SODO Station would be closed, and a new pedestrian grade-separated crossing of both existing and new tracks would be used to access both stations. The station would not include the South Stacy Street cul-de-sac access to the west, and instead would include an access point at South Lander Street. This alternative would continue south at-grade under South Lander Street, which would be reconstructed as an overpass of the light rail tracks.</p>
                <p>Other alternatives:</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">At-Grade Alternative (SODO-1a):</span> would begin north of the existing SODO Station and travel at-grade west of and parallel to the existing Link light rail line in the SODO Busway. The new SODO Station on the West Seattle Link Extension would be at-grade, immediately west of the existing SODO Station, north of South Lander Street, in a staggered configuration. The existing at-grade pedestrian crossing of the light rail tracks at SODO Station would be closed, and a new grade-separated pedestrian crossing of both existing and new tracks would be used to access both stations. South Stacy Street would be extended from 4th Avenue South to a cul-de-sac on the west side of the station.  This alternative would continue south at-grade under South Lander Street, which would be reconstructed as an overpass of the light rail tracks.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">At-Grade South Station Option (SODO-1b):</span> would be similar to the At-Grade Alternative except for the SODO Station. A new at-grade station on the West Seattle Link Extension would be west of and approximately 200 feet south of the existing SODO Station, just north of South Lander Street. The existing SODO Station would be relocated to just north of South Lander Street. Pedestrian access would be from a new South Lander Street overcrossing.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Mixed Profile Alternative (SODO-2):</span> would begin at-grade north of the existing SODO Station, west of and parallel to the existing Link light rail line in the existing SODO Busway. At South Walker Street, the alignment would transition to an elevated profile and would continue south over South Lander Street. The existing SODO Station would be relocated as described for At Grade South Station Option and would be at-grade adjacent to the new elevated station. Pedestrian access would be on the north side of South Lander Street and from 4th Avenue South and 6th Avenue South. A new pedestrian grade-separated crossing of both existing and new tracks would be used to access both the new and relocated station.</p>
                <h3>Duwamish segment</h3>
                <p class="fw-bold">Preferred Alternative: South Crossing Alternative (DUW-1a)</p>
                <p>Would continue south from South Forest Street along the west side of the existing light rail line on an elevated guideway, past the Operations and Maintenance Facility Central before heading southwest to cross over to the south side of the Spokane Street Bridge and the West Seattle Bridge. The alternative would continue west and to the south side of the West Seattle Bridge. The alternative would cross over the East Duwamish Waterway, Harbor Island, and the West Duwamish Waterway on a fixed, light rail only bridge. West of the Duwamish Waterway crossing, the alternative would cross the northern edge of Pigeon Point in a combination of elevated guideway and retained cut and fill before turning southwest on an elevated guideway that crosses Delridge Way Southwest. A connection to the Operations and Maintenance Facility Central would be provided from tracks between South Forest Street and South Spokane Street.</p>
                <p>Other alternatives:</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">South Crossing South Edge Crossing Alignment Option (DUW-1b):</span> similar to the preferred alternative, except it would cross the East and West Duwamish Waterways on the south side of Harbor Island.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">North Crossing Alternative (DUW-2):</span> would continue south from South Forest Street along the west side of the existing light rail line on an elevated guideway, before heading west on a new fixed, light rail only bridge north of the existing West Seattle Bridge. After crossing the West Duwamish Waterway, the alternative would cross over the West Seattle Bridge to run south on the west side of Delridge Way Southwest. A connection to the Operations and Maintenance Facility Central would be provided from north and south access tracks between South Forest Street and South Spokane Street.</p>
                <h3>Delridge segment</h3>

The station would be elevated between Delridge Way Southwest and 26th Avenue Southwest, south of Southwest Dakota Street, and oriented southwest-northeast. South of the station, the alternative would curve west and cross to the south side of the Southwest Genesee Street right-of-way, north of the West Seattle Golf Course. The guideway would continue west along the south edge of Southwest Genesee Street and connect to an elevated guideway in the West Seattle Junction Segment.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Dakota Street Station North Alignment Option (DEL-1b):</span> would be similar to the alternative above except it would be within the Southwest Genesee Street right-of-way between the West Seattle Golf Course and the Longfellow Creek Natural Area, then shift to the north side of Southwest Genesee Street west of 28th Avenue Southwest.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Dakota Street Station Lower Height Alternative (DEL-2a):</span> would be similar to the Dakota Street Station Alternative except would be at a lower elevation to connect to tunnel alternatives in the West Seattle Junction Segment. From the station, the alternative would continue south to cross Southwest Genesee Street and would run along the northern edge of the West Seattle Golf Course. A tunnel portal for connecting to tunnel alternatives in the West Seattle Junction Segment would be in the northwest corner of the West Seattle Golf Course, south of Southwest Genesee Street and east of 31st Avenue Southwest.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Dakota Street Station Lower Height North Alignment Option (DEL-2b):</span> would be similar to the Dakota Street Station Lower Height Alternative except it would shift to the north side of Southwest Genesee Street west of 28th Avenue Southwest. The tunnel portal to enter a tunnel in the West Seattle Junction Segment would be north of Southwest Genesee Street, between Southwest Avalon Way and 30th Avenue Southwest.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Delridge Way Station Alternative (DEL-3):</span> would follow Delridge Way Southwest south on an elevated guideway to the Delridge Station. The station would be in the middle of Delridge Way Southwest, north of Southwest Dakota Street. South of the station, the alternative would curve west and cross to the south side of the Southwest Genesee Street right-of-way, north of the West Seattle Golf Course. The guideway would continue west along the south edge of Southwest Genesee Street and connect to an elevated guideway in the West Seattle Junction Segment.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Delridge Way Station Lower Height Alternative (DEL-4):</span> would follow the same alignment as the Delridge Way Station Alternative to the station but would be at a lower elevation to connect to tunnel alternatives in the West Seattle Junction Segment. From the station, the alternative would continue south on the west side of Delridge Way Southwest and then turn west at Southwest Genesee Street, crossing Southwest Genesee Street to run along the northern edge of the West Seattle Golf Course. A tunnel portal for connecting to tunnel alternatives in the West Seattle Junction Segment would be in the northwest corner of the West Seattle Golf Course, south of Southwest Genesee Street and east of 31st Avenue Southwest.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Andover Street Station Alternative (DEL-5):</span> would be on an elevated guideway on the west side of Delridge Way Southwest, north of Southwest Andover Street. The alignment would travel west along Southwest Andover Street on an elevated guideway then south along Southwest Avalon Way in the vicinity of Southwest Yancy Street. The guideway would continue south along Southwest Avalon Way and turn west on the north side of Southwest Genesee Street. The station would be elevated, north of Southwest Andover Street and west of Delridge Way Southwest, in a northeast-southwest orientation.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Andover Street Station Lower Height Alternative (DEL-6a):</span> would be similar to the Andover Street Station Alternative up to and including the station. The elevated guideway would cross over Southwest Avalon Way and then turn south in the vicinity of 32nd Avenue Southwest to travel south along the east side of the West Seattle Bridge connection to Fauntleroy Way Southwest, transitioning from elevated into a retained cut. The alignment would turn west in the vicinity of Southwest Genesee Street in a retained cut, passing below Southwest Genesee Street.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Andover Street Station Lower Height No Avalon Station Tunnel Connection (DEL-7):</span> included to connect to the No Avalon Station Tunnel Alternative in the West Seattle Junction segment, which was included at the direction of the Sound Transit Board (Motion 2022-57) to study elimination of the Avalon Station as a potential cost-savings measure. This alternative would be similar to the Preferred Alternative up to and including Delridge Station and reflects a more direct alignment between the Delridge Station and the West Seattle Junction Station with the elimination of an Avalon Station in the West Seattle Junction Segment. South of the station, the elevated guideway would continue west along Southwest Yancy Street and cross to the south side of Southwest Andover Street in an elevated guideway. A tunnel portal leading to the No Avalon Station Tunnel Alternative in the West Seattle Junction Segment would be in the vicinity of 32nd Avenue Southwest, east of the West Seattle Bridge.

      <h3 class="font-italic mt-4">What is station planning?</h3>
      <p class="pe-5 mt-0">Station planning involves studying alternatives in various ways from the neighborhood’s perspective, including how people get to the station and ways we can make these trips safer and more convenient. We also look at opportunities to create housing, office space, shops, or public open space, considering what we’ve heard from community members about their needs and desires.</p>
      <p>Your feedback about stations will help inform ongoing station design. Check out each station page and take the survey by clicking the station name at the top of this page.</p>

      <h3 class="font-italic mt-4">What does station planning include?</h3>
      <p class="mt-0">Each station area would be designed to make it easy to get to the station and move through the station area while walking, rolling, or biking. This can be accomplished by locating station entrances so they are easy to see and by providing safe biking, rolling, and walking routes to connect the station to the neighborhood. Design elements include enhancements to sidewalks, crosswalks, wayfinding, and storage for bikes and scooters.</p>

      <p class="mt-0">For passengers coming to the station by bus, taxi, rideshare, or drop-off, the transfer to light rail should be a simple and intuitive experience. Sound Transit and its agency partners prioritize walking, rolling, biking, and bus transfers over other vehicle modes. Design considerations may include enhancements to neighboring bus stops, drop-off areas, and Paratransit, as well as potential features such as slow streets, transit-only streets, and mobility hubs.</p>

      <p class="mt-0">Adding a light rail station to a neighborhood introduces new opportunities to add different types of housing, new shopping, employment opportunities, and public open space or other recreational amenities. Sound Transit works with city and community partners (private and nonprofit partners) to redevelop property acquired for light rail construction that is not needed for permanent transit operations. We prioritize affordable housing and other uses that benefit communities.

    <p class="mb-4">Sound Transit, the City of Seattle, King County Metro, and other agency partners, such as the Port of Seattle, worked throughout 2020 and 2021 to evaluate the WSBLE Draft EIS station alternatives and offer ideas and recommendations in response to the community priorities we heard. This work is summarized in a Station Planning Progress Report that we published alongside the WSBLE Draft EIS to help communities understand the opportunities and challenges of the different alternatives. Please note this is for reference only as we have continued to refine the preliminary design and location of stations as part of the environmental review process.

      <p>In July 2022, after reviewing the WSBLE Draft EIS and <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/documents-reports/west-seattle-ballard-link-extensions-draft-environmental-impact-1" target="_blank">the comments from Tribes, the public and agency partners</a>, the Sound Transit Board identified the<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-original-title="Preferred alternatives indicate a preference among alternatives but is not a final decision or obligation.

      <p>After a period of further studies from August 2022 to February 2023, the Sound Transit Board identified a preferred alternative for the Ballard Link Extension. Read the March 2023 <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/st_sharepoint/download/sites/PRDA/ActiveDocuments/Motion%20M2023-18.pdf" target="_blank">Board Motion</a> and <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/sound-transit-board-identifies-preferred-alternative" target="_blank">press release</a> for more information.</p>
      <p>The extensions were initially on the same environmental review timeline. However, given additional environmental review needed for project refinements for BLE resulting from the Sound Transit Board action in March 2023 and July 2023, environmental review for the two extensions will now proceed on different timelines. </p>
      <p>WSLE will proceed to a Final EIS, which is anticipated to be published in 2024, while a new Draft EIS will be completed for BLE. The BLE alternatives will be updated, including analysis of the preferred alternative, as well as other refinements and alternatives identified in March 2023 Board Motion.  The new BLE Draft EIS will build upon and incorporate the existing work to date on the WSBLE Draft EIS including all previous scoping comments, public outreach and feedback and environmental analysis. The BLE environmental review timeline will be updated when it is available.</p>
      
      <p>We'll adjust our engagement efforts for each extension, based on upcoming milestones for each project.

          <p>Sound Transit is committed to centering communities along the project corridor and engaging communities of color and low-income and other vulnerable populations throughout the public involvement process. During the environmental review process, Sound Transit conducted an <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/8-wsble-drafteis-appendixg-environmentaljustice-202201.pdf" target="_blank">environmental justice analysis</a>, which is included in the WSBLE Draft EIS. The analysis:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Describes the demographics of the project corridor.</li>
            <li>Evaluates whether the projects would result in disproportionately high and adverse effects to communities of color and low-income communities.</li>
            <li>Considers potential project benefits such as improved access to opportunity.</li>
            <li>Documents our efforts to involve communities of color and low-income populations in the planning process and what we have heard so far from outreach efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Along with the Draft EIS environmental justice analysis, Sound Transit and the City of Seattle have partnered on the Racial Equity Toolkit (RET) process for the projects. The RET lays out a process and a set of questions to guide the development, implementation and evaluation of the projects to advance racial equity. The RET process began early in project development, informing data analysis, technical evaluation and the focus and extent of community engagement. During the environmental review phase, the RET builds on the environmental justice assessment for the projects, documenting potential project impacts and benefits, and community feedback. However, given that the RET process is guided by a different framework than the EIS environmental justice requirements, the report on the RET process and findings is structured differently, and is oriented around <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-original-title="Advance environmental and economic justice to improve economic and health outcomes for communities of color; Enhance mobility and access for communities of color and low income populations; Create opportunities for equitable development that include expanding housing and community assets for communities of color; Avoid disproportionate impacts on communities of color and low income populations; Create a sense of belonging for communities of color at all stations, making spaces where everyone sees themselves as belonging, feeling safe, and welcome; and Meaningfully involve communities of color and low income populations in the project.">RET outcomes</span> for the projects. Our <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/WSBLE-racial-equity-toolkit-report-environmental.pdf">RET report</a> on the process, requirements, outcomes, findings and community feedback is available for your reference. </p>

      <p>In order to build the West Seattle Extension project, Sound Transit will need to purchase and use private property. In some cases, this means moving people from their homes or businesses.</p>
      <p>Sound Transit’s property acquisition process treats affected property owners and tenants fairly, provides appropriate Just Compensation and relocation benefits and minimizes hardships with all parties involved. We realize that the possibility of being relocated from your home or business may be difficult and we are here to answer questions and provide support throughout the process. </p>
      <p>Sound Transit has specific policies and procedures that describe how the agency will work with property owners and tenants throughout the acquisition process. We follow federal, state and local laws in our property acquisition process, more specifically the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, as well as state law. </p>

      When will I be notified if my property may be affected? 
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Potentially affected property owners are notified prior to the release of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Being a potentially affected property owner means that your property is close to one or more alternatives we are currently studying. This notification of potential impact <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span> mean a decision has been made to purchase your property.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion thr mb-0 pb-0" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion" style="font-style: oblique; font-weight: 600; border-bottom: none;">
      What happens if Sound Transit identifies my property as potentially affected? 
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Notification that your property is potentially affected does not mean a decision has been made to purchase your property. But it does mean there’s a possibility Sound Transit may need to acquire all or a portion of your property at a later project phase. As we refine project design, we’ll continue updating our list of potentially affected properties. We won’t make final determinations on which properties to purchase until after a Final EIS and the Sound Transit Board selects the projects to be built.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion thr mb-0 pb-0" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion" style="font-style: oblique; font-weight: 600; border-bottom: none;">
      If I am required to move, what types of relocation assistance can I expect?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>Residential&nbsp;relocation</strong><br>For residential property owners and tenants, Sound Transit provides three primary types of relocation assistance: advisory assistance, moving expenses and replacement housing payments. A qualified relocation specialist will work with displaced residents to determine needs, explain benefits, and provide referrals to current housing inventories as well as assistance and advice with filing claims.</p>
      <p><strong>Business&nbsp;relocation</strong><br>Sound Transit provides three primary types of relocation assistance: advisory assistance, moving expenses and business reestablishment expenses. The level of benefits and advisory services may be different for each displaced business depending on complexity of the business operation.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion thr mb-0 pb-0" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion" style="font-style: oblique; font-weight: 600; border-bottom: none;">
      What does the acquisition process look like? 
    </button>
    
    <div class="panel">
      <p>After the Sound Transit Board has selected the projects to be built and the Federal Transit Administration has issued a Record of Decision, the Board will authorize property purchases along the final project corridors. Several steps will take place before this authorization can occur, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preparing property information to inform the Sound Transit Board’s authorization.</li>
        <li>Identifying the type of acquisition (i.e., full or partial acquisition, temporary or permanent easement).</li>
        <li>Officially notifying property owners that their property is being considered for acquisition by the Sound Transit Board and providing the date of the meeting at which the Board will consider authorizing acquisitions. Staff will notify property owners in advance of the Sound Transit Board meeting date where property acquisition will be discussed followed by an opportunity to provide public comments on the matter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After authorization by&nbsp;the Sound Transit Board, Sound Transit will begin the property acquisition process, which follows these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Appraisal is conducted by an independent appraiser to determine fair market value.</li>
          <li>Appraisal is reviewed by a second appraiser for compliance with proper methodology and appropriate value conclusions.</li>
          <li>Sound Transit prepares an offer package and delivers it to the property owner to review and negotiate. Property owners are also provided a copy of the appraisal.</li>
          <li>Sound Transit negotiates to purchase the property.</li>
          <li>Sound Transit&nbsp;may also reimburse for some or all of the following:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
          <li>Owner’s own appraisal</li>
          <li>Legal review of offer</li>
          <li>Accounting review for tax purposes</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li><span>For people and businesses displaced by the projects, a r</span>elocation agent will meet with the property owner to explain relocation assistance, eligibility and entitlements.</li>
        </ol>

      Other Frequently Asked Questions  
    </button>
    
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>Q: </strong>What is the average timeframe from&nbsp;the offer to closure of sale?<br> <strong>A: </strong>While each acquisition is unique, most&nbsp;processes can take anywhere between 12-18 months to complete.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: </strong>Does Sound Transit pay closing costs?<br> <strong>A: </strong>Sound Transit will pay for all normal sale expenses including escrow fees, title insurance, pre-payment penalties, mortgage release fee, recording fees and all typical costs related to conveying title. The sale will be exempt from real estate excise tax.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: </strong>If my house does have to be acquired and I have to relocate, am I able to stay in the same school district or buy a similar home?<br> <strong>A: </strong>Sound Transit will make every effort to find comparable properties within the desired market.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: </strong>Is there a geographical boundary limit for relocation?<br> <strong>A: </strong>No, there is no geographical limit on where you can move. Sound Transit will pay moving expenses within a 50-mile range.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: </strong>If there is a long delay between acquisition and when construction starts, will there be empty houses in neighborhoods for several years?<br> <strong>A: </strong>While acquisitions are tied to the project schedule, it is possible that homes could be vacated prior to construction starting. If that occurs, Sound Transit will take appropriate measures to secure the properties until demolition can take place.</p>
